# Define item prices, quantities, discount rate, and tax rate

# Calculate total cost before any discounts or taxes
total_cost = sum(price * quantity for price, quantity in zip(item_prices, quantities))

# Apply discount
discounted_total_cost = total_cost - (discount_rate / 100) * total_cost

# Apply tax
